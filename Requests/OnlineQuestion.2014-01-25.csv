Jonathan,Chrzanowski,,Purdue University,,,,,,,U.S.A.,,,,jchrzano@purdue.edu,"Hello,\r\nI recently ordered a 200 mL stainless steel syringe and I had a quick question. There's a significant amount of grease to lubricate the seals inside the syringe which is not compatible with our chemicals. Am I correct in assuming I can clean out the grease from the syringe and use a small amount of Krytox to lubricate those seals? I wanted to ensure this wouldn't cause a leak before I did it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\nJonathan"

Can you tell me when we might expect to get it? Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGilda Mills"
