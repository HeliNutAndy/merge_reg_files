CHIU from the department of ophthalmolgy, the University of Hong Kong. \r\n\r\nI am interested in the Harvard Appratus system  FISO-LS Fiber Optic Pressure Sensing System. \r\n\r\nThe pressure rate I hope to detect it at least to 200 mmHg. The accuracy  for the IOP should be ideally at 0.01 mmHg. I need to have the record so that can be used for record and further analysis. I will use that for rats and rabbits. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nCatherine"
