Yuan,Lei,,Fudan Univeisity,Eye and ENT hospital,,,,,,CHINA,,,,lilian0167@hotmail.com,I purchased the pump 33 when I was in Bioengineering Department in Imperial College London. The pump relocated with me to Fudan University in Shanghai. Recently the pusher block became stuck and can not be moved by pulling and turning the knob anymore. I just wondered how should I solve this problem. Thank you!
