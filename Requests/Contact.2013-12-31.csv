Bret,Stephens,Mr.,Wasatch Scientific Services,,2401 Foothill Dr.,Wasatch Scientific Services,Salt Lake City,UT,84109,U.S.A.,8016969598,,Work,bret@wasatchscientific.com,"I am interested in getting some enteric coated capsuels for rats. I was looking in your catalog (#721690) and the description said that enteric coating was available, but I didn't see an additional catalog number for that. I was wondering if you sold the enteric coated capsules, or does it just mean that I can coat my own if I want to. Any reply you could give me would be appreciated."
Reinhard,Schulte,Professor,Loma Linda University,Radiation Medicine,,,,,,U.S.A.,,,Work,rschulte@llu.edu,"We are developing advanced treatment techniques with protons using small (rats) to large (sheep) animal models. We need respiratory motion control during the experimental procedures (imaging and treatment). Would your ventilators provide high frequency jet ventilation, which leaves lungs in an almost motion-less state for an arbitrary time. Applied tidal volumes are usually around 15 mL/kg, and a typical frequency would be 5 Hz, I assume."
