Sandra,Estevez,Research Assistant,Memorial University of Newfoundland,MRP,,,,,,CANADA,(709) 864-8776,(709) 864-8776,Work,sestevez12@mun.ca,"We purchased one of your syringe pumps (11 plus) from Waters and and got the pump just with a 220V power cord.  The pump came with a ITE power supply that is specified for 100-240 V.  We tried to use this power supply with a generic HONGLIN E254927 HL-002 HL-004 10A 125V Power Cable Cord but we are getting the message RATE VOL CONFIG\r\nPOWER FAIL.  Any suggestions for the reason of the failure?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSandra"
