I will use the pump to push a small amount of fruit juice directly in the mouth of the participant when the correct answer is selected during a task.\r\nWhich is the best pump to run this study?\r\nIMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER ARE:\r\nThe pump must be controlled by a computer (preferably via a TTL from the parallel port).\r\nThe pump should control a relatively large syringe (to allow a large number of trials to be run before the need to change the syringe).\r\nThe juice will be pushed through a ~10 meters plastic tube\r\nPlease let me know what are my options and how much for each option.\r\nThanks in advance for the information.\r\nFrancesco Versace"
