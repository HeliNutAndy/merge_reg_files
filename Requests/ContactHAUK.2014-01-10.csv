Elizabeth,Greally,,Newcastle University,Institute of Human Genetics,,,,,,UNITED KINGDOM,,,,elizabeth.greally@ncl.ac.uk,"Hello,\r\nI am looking for a warming system suitable for use with small animal MRI. Could you tell me if this heat therapy pump could be used http://www.harvardapparatus.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/haisku2_10001_11555_39351_-1_HAUK_ProductDetail_N_37610_37625. The pump itself could be kept in the MRI control room and so the question is more about whether the connectors could be lengthened and if the heat pads are MRI compatible. Alternatively can you suggest any suitable alternative?\r\nMany thanks,\r\nLiz"
