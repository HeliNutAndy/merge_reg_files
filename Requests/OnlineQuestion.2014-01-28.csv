Fangyun,Tian,,,,,,,,,U.S.A.,,,,fangyun@umich.edu,"I have some questions about the 683 small animal ventilator. Could you please help me with them? Thank you.\r\n\r\n1. If I just want to introduce room air, do I need to connect the bottom port to a room air tank?\r\n\r\n2. Do you have a more clear ventilator graph for choosing tidal volume and rate? The ventilator graph on user's manual is fuzzy. \r\n\r\n3. When I turned on the ventilator, I heard a noise. I think it is from the friction between cylinder and piston. Is this normal? Do I need to add some lubricant to reduce the noise?"
