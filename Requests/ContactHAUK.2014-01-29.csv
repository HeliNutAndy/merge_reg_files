I found one pump from your website 'The Harvard PHD 22/2000 Programmable pump' and am wondering that will it be suitable for my research? I basically need to feed one or two different fluids into my system and also need to pull the fluid from the system I made as a closed loop. \r\n\r\nThose silicone tubes that I used are smaller than 2mm (inner diameter). I will be gratefully if you can provide some advice of the machine I mentioned above and also send me a quote/lead-time of the machine shortly. \r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nChing-Mei Chen"
